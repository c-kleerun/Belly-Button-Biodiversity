# Belly Button Biodiversity

This project creates an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This data catalogs the microbes that colonize human belly buttons. This dataset explores operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, and their prevalance among the test subjects. It revealed that only a small handful of OTUs were present in the majority of subjects. 

This project created several graphs that update based on the test subject number. These graphs were placed into a dashboard for user interactivity. The user chooses a Test Subject ID number from a drop down and will be shown information for that subject including:  
<ul>
  <li> A demographics table that shows age, gender, location and ethnicity of the selected test subject. 
  <li> A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs found in a particular subject
  <li> A bubble chart showing the entireity of the OTUs found in a particular sample
  <li> A gauge that shows the number of times a subject scrubs their belly button each week. 
 
Below is a sample of the dashboard:
